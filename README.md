# ***VBA-stock-project***

## Overview of VBA Project: 

Analysis Purpose:
This project analyzed the stock market from 2017-2018 for our friend Steve. We want to look at the thousands of stock trends of the year and access the volume of all the stock tickers in our data. This way, we have quantitative knowledge on trends Steve can use next year. By playing with VBA and pivoting around this data, we can see when stock hit certain points. We also have the ability to create charts from our analysis that will graph how stock moved those years. Steve can see exactly which tickers have positive or negative return, as well as which had the best return of money.

## Results: 
  
## Summary: 

### Advantages
The advantages of refactoring code are that it runs faster, you can apply code to shorten hour long process. It can make analyzing and pivoting data a lot easier after its extracted. Like with this VBA code, we can use excel as a calculator for year-end results to analyze. Once all the code is done and looped, we can repeat this is seconds.

### Disadvantages
One obvious disadvantage is sometimes the comments are not clear. When making updates, it is easy to lose sight of why it needs to be updated. You also may accidently remove a crucial piece of source code, by trying to clean up code. It can also be time consuming finding ways to improve what is already there. It takes hours to go through code in VBA and sometimes the updates only shave off seconds of work. There was also room for a lot of errors and bugs when updating the code. Constant errors with updted variables or run time errors sing more than one language.
